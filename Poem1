Through life's twists and turns we roam,
In friendship's embrace, we find our home.
A bond that's true, through thick and thin,
With laughter, support, and love within.

Bestfriend
Through thick and thin, you're always there,
A bond so strong, beyond compare.
A friend like you, a precious find,
In heart and soul, forever intertwined.

Laughter shared, and tears embraced,
In each other's souls, a sacred space.
Through highs and lows, we find our way,
Friendship's treasure, come what may.
